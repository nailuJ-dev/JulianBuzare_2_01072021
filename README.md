Second project of the Openclassroom web developer course. The main goal of this project is to integrate a responsive HTML and CSS model of the Reservia website, a website for planning vacations and booking accommodations and activities in the city of the client's choice.

## The functionalities of the website

- Users will be able to search for accommodations in cities of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However and at this stage, the search button will not be functional.
- Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable in its entirety. But for this moment, the links will be empty.
- Filters will not be functional for this version but they should change their appearance when hovering.
- In the navigation section, the links "Accommodations" and "Activities" are anchors that should lead to the relevant sections.

## Technical constraints

- Two mock-ups: one for desktop computers and one for mobile devices. The site must also be adapted to tablets.
- Choose the most suitable format in accordance with the resolution and the loading time.
- Do not use any CSS framework or pre-compiler (use HTML and CSS)
- Use CSS Grid
- The websitesite must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers.
- Version the code with Git and deploy it on the GitHub or GitLab

## Notes on the project's implementation

The website respects the functionalities and technical constraints for the model integration.

In order to facilitate the code, the model has been delimited into different parts through semantic markers to structure the page.
  
The responsive part has been integrated directly into the CSS file "style.css"

This project's version has been test on the Chrome, Firefox and browsers. 
  
This actual code doesn't contain any errors in the W3C HTML and CSS validator.
  
The code has been versioned on GIT and deployed on GITHUB at the following address https://github.com/nailuJ-dev/Reservia_website_OC_Project2/
 
## Notes on using my tools
For this project, I used the VISUAL STUDIO CODE editor, the plugins LIVE SERVER & EMMET , GITHUB and its terminal GITBASH.
