## The functionalities of the website

- Users will be able to search for accommodations in cities of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However and at this stage, the search button will not be functional.
- Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable in its entirety. But for this moment, the links will be empty.
- Filters will not be functional for this version but they should change their appearance when hovering.
- In the navigation section, the links "Accommodations" and "Activities" are anchors that should lead to the relevant sections.

## Technical constraints


## Notes on the project's implementation

The website respects the functionalities and technical constraints for the model integration.

In order to facilitate the code, the model has been delimited into different parts through semantic markers to structure the page.

Zone delimiting markers :
  - HEADER for the header of the website 
  - NAV for the navigation items 
  - MAIN for the main content
  - SECTION for the independent content
  - ARTICLE for the more precise division
  - FOOTER for the footer

Content markers :
  - p, a, span, ul, li, strong, etc.
  
The responsive part has been integrated directly into the CSS file "style.css"

This project's version has been test on the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers. 
  
This actual code doesn't contain any errors in the W3C HTML and CSS validator.
  
The code has been versioned on GIT and deployed on GITHUB at the following address
